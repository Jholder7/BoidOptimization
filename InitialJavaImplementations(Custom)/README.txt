The code housed in this file was our initial attempt at implementing boid simulation in my custom particle engine; however,
we ran into some very problematic issues due to simulating the world in the fourth quadrant of a quadrant plan. To fix these problems
and allow quadtree optimization to work, we would have to rework the engine, and we had very little time left, so we revered the P5.js engine and open source solutions.
